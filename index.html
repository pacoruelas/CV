                        As a Test engineer IV in the StackTest team, I was responsible for on-boarding new customers on our test framework not only by supporting the tool but also by reinforcing best practices on systems testing while improving the test framework for scalability, performance, usability and maintainability. In this role I lead the team in the exploration of new (to the team) technologies with the goals of making the solution architecture more resilient, introduce a CICD pipeline that covers new deployments (IaC) and automate delivery targeting specific sites. Also, in this position I was supporting  the infrastructure of a data pipeline that collected data from heterogeneous sources to present it in dashboards using Elasticsearch/Kibana.

I was also responsible for the interfaces between flexBench and the MES and between flexBench and the hardware that enables features like the LED visual auto test and device auto-discovery (based on SNTP). I also developed other solutions based on computer vision like visual auto inspections and label/form data gathering using OpenCV, Tesseract, Dmtx and ZBar.
                        Finally, I had the chance to develop a loader for an Electronic Shelf Label (ESL).
