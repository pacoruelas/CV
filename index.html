                        Led the team using the Agile methodology in the exploration of new technologies (to the team) with the goal of making the solution architecture more resilient and its deployment and rollback seamless. During this project I implemented DevOps pipeline and SDLC best practices improving the quality of our deployments by automatically detecting errors and automating the deployments. We achieved the goal of having the POC in 4 months.
